#  Case Study: Strengthening Fraud Risk Detection through Data-Driven Insights  

## ðŸ“Œ Context  
Digital platforms face increasing fraud threats, from fake registrations to transaction manipulation. For a fintech company, the challenge was not just detecting fraud but ensuring **clean, reliable datasets** to train fraud detection models and improve decision-making.  

As a **Data Analyst (Fraud Risk)**, my role was to design a framework to:  
- Detect abnormal behavior  
- Improve data integrity  
- Provide actionable insights for risk and operations teams  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- **Enhance Data Quality** â€“ Clean, validate, and preprocess large volumes of customer transaction and behavioral data.  
- **Identify Fraud Patterns** â€“ Analyze correlations and anomalies that signal fraudulent activity.  
- **Enable Cross-Team Decisions** â€“ Build dashboards and reports that translate complex data into clear, risk-focused insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Approach  

### 1. Data Collection & Cleaning  
- Pulled transaction and user activity data from **SQL-based data warehouse**.  
- Implemented preprocessing steps: missing value imputation, duplicate removal, and feature standardization.  
- Designed **rules-based flags** (e.g., unusually high transaction frequency, duplicate IDs, or login from multiple devices).  

### 2. Pattern & Correlation Analysis  
- Applied **Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)** for exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- Identified correlations between suspicious behaviors (e.g., multiple failed logins + sudden large transactions).  
- Built **statistical models** (Z-score outlier detection, clustering) to surface fraud-prone segments.  

### 3. Reporting & Dashboards  
- Developed a **Tableau dashboard** with fraud KPIs:  
  - Suspicious user ratio (%)  
  - Abnormal transaction frequency  
  - Fraud type distribution (bot registrations, mule accounts, chargeback cases)  
- Added **drill-down capability** by region, transaction type, and time to support investigations.  

### 4. Cross-Team Collaboration  
- Partnered with **Fraud Ops team** to validate flagged cases.  
- Delivered insights in **English and Mandarin**, ensuring smooth alignment with China-based counterparts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcomes  
âœ… **Data Accuracy** â€“ Reduced duplicate/mismatched entries by **30%**, improving fraud model training datasets.  
âœ… **Fraud Detection** â€“ Identified **15% more suspicious accounts** through anomaly correlation analysis.  
âœ… **Faster Decision-Making** â€“ Tableau dashboard reduced investigation turnaround time by **40%**.  
âœ… **Business Impact** â€“ Strengthened trust in fraud controls, balancing risk mitigation with customer experience.

## ðŸŽ¯ Tools & Skills Applied  
- **SQL** â€“ Data extraction, preprocessing pipelines  
- **Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)** â€“ EDA, anomaly detection  
- **Excel** â€“ Ad-hoc validation, quick trend checks  
- **Tableau** â€“ Fraud risk dashboard for stakeholders  
- **Communication** â€“ Presented insights to English and Mandarin-speaking teams  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaway  
By combining **data cleaning, fraud pattern analysis, and clear visualization**, I created a fraud detection system that not only improved model training quality but also empowered cross-functional teams with faster, more accurate insights.
